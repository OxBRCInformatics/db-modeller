# Disparate datasource modeller

This tool helps gather information about contributing systems for software development. If you need to integrate a bunch of different data sources this tool can help you record that information and store it in a sharable format from datasources such as:

* Relational databases
* Graph databases
* NoSQL databases such as MongoDB
* Excel documents

## What this tool doesn't do

This tool alone will not solve your data management needs! at this time it is not intended to be a long-living Single Point of Truth for database management, although it may be useful for some aspects of data management. It is primarily a tool to ease the rapid development of data-centric applications in disparate environments such as NHS Trusts.
