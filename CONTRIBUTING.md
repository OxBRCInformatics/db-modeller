At this point you're waiting on us, so go and make a coffee and congratulate yourself on contributing to the open-source community!

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests that exercise the behaviour of your code.
* Follow the style of existing sources (we'll make a style guide at some point)
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
